# Functional MRI networks of post-covid patients
## About
42 patients (32 females, 10 males, mean age 56) have reported subjective complaints such as loss of focus and brain fogs following a COVID-19 infection. Clinical tests carried out have shown low scores in memory, attention, and executive control.

In this study, we analyse their functional networks that stem from resting state fMRI sessions and compare them to a control group (46 pre-pandemic patients with normal scores on their clinical tests).

## Types of analysis
We make two types of analysis: one that compares the topology of functional networks *after* dividing in groups (classical approach), and one that attempts to divide in groups just by looking at the functional networks (data-driven approach, or RSA (Representation Similarity Analysis)).

## Usage
To perform group-based analysis, the ```-g``` flag must be added to the command-line.
